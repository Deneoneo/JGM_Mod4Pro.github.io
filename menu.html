    <p>Charleen Badman's terrific leek gratin, topped with mozzarella, a fried egg and mustardy bread crumbs</p></div>

            Lamb Salad with Fregola:
        </p>

        <p>The roast lamb, sweet onions and arugula are all local; the chewy fregola and the capers in the salad's piquant dressing are not. Before opening Stellina, Caiazzo ran the grilled cheese stand at the Point Reyes Station farmers' market.</p>

           Smoked Pork Jowl with Pickles:

        <p>
            slowly smoked cured pork jowl over pecan wood and serves thin slices of the luscious meat as an appetizer with as many pickled ingredients as possible, including house-made half-sour pickles, pickled chiles and pickled mustard seeds stirred into the blackstrap-molasses garnish

            Scallop Sashimi with Meyer Lemon Confit:

        <p>
            a sliver of scallop sashimi with lightly sweet Meyer lemon confit, crunchy toasted buckwheat kernels and—pushing it over the top—tiny pieces of compressed apple, vacuum-packed to concentrate the flavor.

            Vegan Charcuterie:
        </p>
        <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F9%2F2010%2F12%2F201012-ss-dishes-charcuterie.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Arranged on that board are five or so inspired vegetable dishes that might include fantastic roasted broccoli with a vegan version of the Italian tuna-based sauce tonnato (made here with seaweed and miso). Another great thing about Gather's charcuterie: Unlike the cured-meat kind, his changes seasonally.
